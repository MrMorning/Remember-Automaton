## Remember Automaon-记忆自动机
### Introduction
This program is written to make it easier for people to manage their knowledge.

In one important exam, I found there's a point that i've learned before but i forget it that time.

there is a widely spread opinion that if a programmer doesn't find some tools, he would build one by himself. So, I didnt find a easy-to-use tool, i wrote one.

this program is based on the theorem of Ebbinghaus

### Usage
You can simply run the code below:
```
python main.py
```
then you'll get it.

however, you should have sth to review.

there is two approaches to get materials i provide.

1. add the materials manually, the rem.info is:
number, last review, correct review times, total review times and Ebbinghaus function.

2. A script to get it from sth you've collected before.

the second means is a feature i'm developping.

### Feature Request
1. the script
2. time used to review -> s

$$ R = e^{-frac ts}$$
